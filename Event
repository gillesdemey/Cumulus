      <title>Why Cybersecurity Leadership Must Start At The Top</title>
      <description>If the past year has shown us anything, it&amp;rsquo;s that companies should no longer ask if they are going to be hacked and instead when. With every company becoming digital, the pace of change is only accelerating and our ability to make the right decisions on cybersecurity needs to move even faster. Some estimate that between $9 and $21 trillion of global economic value creation could be at risk if companies and governments are unable to successfully combat cyber threats.</description>

      <title>Are Consumer Networking Products Threatening Business Security?</title>
      <description>Security challenges are on the rise and a disproportionate amount of time and money is being spent to counter the intrusions and risks that lurk behind every door. While businesses may rely on enterprise-class networking security from companies like Cisco Systems, Fortinet, Checkpoint Systems or Palo Alto Networks, it is consumer products from the likes of Asus, D-Link, Linksys, Netgear or TRENDnet that could still have an unintended impact on a company&amp;rsquo;s networks and bottom line. Through the increase in employee mobility, it is inevitable that that these inexpensive consumer products are more likely to rub shoulders with your industrial-strength enterprise equipment, potentially putting your networks and business at risk.</description>

      <title>Splunk Provides Adaptive, Operational Intelligence</title>
      <description>A Security Operations Center (SOC) typically monitors the internal network data while Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) provides a dashboard view with bit more control of the alerts generated by the applications and systems hardware. Often these are both reactive activities, notifying system admins only when something has already gone wrong. But what if you could anticipate a problem, and based on the data, create new and better rulesets on the fly?  In that way Splunk, a big data company that seeks to provide security intelligence, is like a SIEM on steroids.</description>

      <title>All Instant Messaging Could Be Killed In The UK Within Weeks</title>
      <description>UK Prime Minister David Cameron is pressing ahead with new powers&amp;nbsp;that plan to stop people from sending any form of encrypted messages. Under the rather Orwellian &quot;Draft Communications Data Bill&quot;&amp;nbsp;(nicknamed&amp;nbsp;Snooper&apos;s Charter) the&amp;nbsp;legislation&amp;nbsp;proposed would require ISPs&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;mobile providers&amp;nbsp;to maintain records of each user&apos;s internet browsing activity (including social media), email correspondence, voice calls, and mobile phone messaging services and store the records for 12 months.</description>
